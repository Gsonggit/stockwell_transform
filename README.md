# stockwell_transform
1-D  S_transform matlab code transfered to Python 

Included:  

1. origin S_transform  (/my_stran.py)

![stockwell](https://github.com/Gsonggit/stockwell_transform/blob/master/origin_s_transform.png)  

**the result is as same as [claudiodsf](https://github.com/claudiodsf/stockwell)  and **[st.m](https://github.com/Gsonggit/stockwell_transform/blob/master/origin_matlab/st.m)****  
**5000 points chirp signal costs 1.2 seconds**

If possible,Will be updated:  
 
(Fast)generalized S_transform;  
(Fast)Discrete orthogonal S_transform;  
2-D S_transform;
