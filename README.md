# stockwell_transform
1-D S_transform matlab code  transfered to Python 

Included:  

1. origin(redundant) S_transform  

![stockwell](/origin s_transform.png)  

the result is as same as [claudiodsf](https://github.com/claudiodsf/stockwell)  


If possible,Will be updated:

Fast S_transform;
(Fast)generalized S_transform;
