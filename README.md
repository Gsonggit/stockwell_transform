**the result is as same as [claudiodsf](https://github.com/claudiodsf/stockwell)  and **[st.m](https://github.com/Gsonggit/stockwell_transform/blob/master/st.m)****  


If possible,Will be updated:  


Fast S_transform;  
(Fast)generalized S_transform;  
(Fast)Discrete orthogonal S_transform;  
2-D S_transform;
